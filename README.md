# microSimulink Library #

## Goals ##

This library aims to provide a rich set of blocks useful for developing realtime code on a microcontroller using Simulink and the RTCoder/RTWorkshop packages. This library is built from code reused during experiments with autonomous vehicles and so is most useful for those applications. As this library expands I aim to extend it to become more relevant for any application of a microcontroller.

## Requirements ##

This blockset relies on nothing besides Simulink to be used. All blocks have been designed to be compileable for microcontroller architectures, but should work fine in standard Simulink projects.
